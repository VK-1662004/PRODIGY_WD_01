                        <p>Emma Stone and Jonah Hill star in this cerebral limited series, created by Patrick Somerville, about two strangers living in a retro-futuristic version of New York City. They meet when they sign up for a peculiar pharmaceutical trial. Both have their own reasons for embarking on the treatment, which the scientists allege can heal their broken minds by forcing them to confront their trauma and blocks to happiness. They’re sent on wild subconscious journeys that allow them to become entirely different people as they’re thrown into a variety of genre-bending situations (like a 1940s séance and one memorable scene involving a lemur).  </p>
