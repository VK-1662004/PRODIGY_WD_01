                    </div>
                    <div class="contain_info">
                        <p>Wednesday Addams, a high-school student, finds her brother Pugsley tied up in a locker. She sees a psychic vision of his bullies, whom she then attempts to kill, resulting in her expulsion. Her parents, Morticia and Gomez, decide to enroll her in Nevermore Academy, their alma mater and a school for outcasts in Jericho, Vermont. Meanwhile, a hiker is killed by an unknown creature near Nevermore. Wednesday's parents release Thing, a sentient disembodied hand, to watch over her. She meets her roommate Enid, her complete opposite, and duels with Bianca, the popular girl, after Bianca bullies a boy named Rowan. Later, Wednesday is nearly killed by a falling gargoyle but is saved by Bianca's ex-boyfriend, Xavier. After escaping her court-ordered therapy session, Wednesday meets Tyler, a coffee barista who agrees to help her escape from Nevermore. However, she is apprehended by Principal Larissa Weems and taken back to the school. Later, Tyler and Wednesday meet at the local carnival, and Wednesday has a vision of Rowan's death. Rowan attempts to kill her but is murdered by the monster.
                        Wednesday convinces a skeptical Sheriff Galpin that the perpetrator of the murders is in fact a monster. Suddenly, Rowan reappears unharmed. Wednesday doubts her sanity and decides to investigate the murders herself. She roams the campus inquiring about Rowan and is told that he has been expelled. Meanwhile, Weems grows worried about Wednesday's visions, keeping close tabs on her. Wednesday confronts a defensive Rowan as he leaves the school and sends Thing to follow him. Thing loses him and Rowan is revealed to be Principal Weems, who has shapeshifted into him. Wednesday has visions of a book belonging to an old students' society. In her search for the book, she overhears Bianca planning to rig the upcoming student tournament. Wednesday joins Enid to defeat Bianca and win the tournament. Later, Wednesday discovers a hidden library within the school, where she is captured.
                        Wednesday finds herself tied up and surrounded by members of an elite students' society, including Bianca and Xavier. Wednesday frees herself and leaves the library, taking one of the books with her. Weems orders Wednesday to play in the school's band at an upcoming town ceremony run by Mayor Noble Walker. A drawing in the book leads her to an exhibition at a local fair, where she notices the painting of a girl she had seen in her visions. In the forest, Wednesday envisions the girl—believed to be an ancestor of hers—ready to be executed by Joseph Crackstone, the town's founder who is intent on killing all outcasts, but the girl is able to escape. Wednesday is ambushed by the monster, which she discovers to be human. Back in town, Wednesday crashes the ceremony by having Thing destroy a commemorative statue of Joseph Crackstone and is scolded by Principal Weems. While investigating a crime scene in the forest, police find a camera that captured photographs of the monster.
                        32 years earlier, Gomez Addams was arrested at Nevermore on suspicion of killing Garrett Gates, a descendant of Joseph Crackstone. In present time, the Addamses visit Wednesday on Parents' Weekend at Nevermore. A family therapy session is cut short when Wednesday confronts her parents about the suspected murder. Meanwhile, Sheriff Galpin learns that the coroner committed suicide after admitting to fabricating Gates's autopsy report. Galpin concludes that Gomez is guilty and arrests him. In prison, Gomez reveals to Wednesday that he was covering for Morticia, who actually killed Gates. Wednesday and Morticia dig up Gates's grave to find that he had been lethally poisoned before he was killed, but are caught by police and arrested for the night. Later, they confront Mayor Walker, who reveals that Garrett intended to poison the entire school due to his father's hate for outcasts. Mayor Walker agrees to release Gomez after admitting to covering up Gates's motive. Back at Nevermore, Principal Weems reluctantly admits to covering up Rowan's death by means of shapeshifting in an effort to evade controversy at the school.
                        Wednesday attempts to summon Goody, an ancestor and fellow psychic who killed Crackstone. During a surprise birthday party, Wednesday has a vision of Goody, who instructs her to seek out the Gates mansion. There, she witnesses Mayor Walker as he is leaving the building and sneaks into his car. After arriving back in town, Mayor Walker is hit by a car and severely injured. Principal Weems locks down the school and forbids Wednesday to leave campus. With Tyler and Enid's help, she escapes and returns to the Gates mansion. There, they discover that Laurel Gates, Garrett's younger sister, long believed to be dead, might still be alive. They find the severed body parts of the monster's victims in a cellar, but are forced to flee after being ambushed by the monster. Wednesday leads Galpin to the cellar, only to find it empty. At Nevermore, Wednesday convinces Weems not to expel her in order to further pursue her investigation. At the hospital, an unknown figure kills Mayor Walker.
                        At Mayor Walker's funeral, Wednesday notices a lurking figure and chases it into the forest. The figure is revealed to be Uncle Fester, who explains to Wednesday that the monster she has been investigating is a Hyde. Together, they retrieve a diary from the hidden library which reveals that a Hyde must always have a master. Later, they track and follow Xavier, who they witness meeting up with Dr. Kinbott, Wednesday's therapist, in the forest. After returning from a date with Tyler, Wednesday finds her dorm room vandalized, the diary stolen, and Thing gravely injured. Research into Laurel Gates reveals that she is both alive and the master of the Hyde. Wednesday initially suspects Dr. Kinbott, but Kinbott is killed by the Hyde. Police arrive to arrest Xavier, who Wednesday believes to be the Hyde. Wednesday meets with Tyler and kisses him but suddenly has a vision of him being the Hyde and runs off.
                        Wednesday and her classmates kidnap Tyler, and Wednesday tortures him to try to make him confess. Disagreeing with her methods, her classmates alert Principal Weems, and Wednesday is arrested. At the police station, Tyler secretly confesses to Wednesday that he is the monster. Fed up with Wednesday's behavior, Weems expels her from Nevermore. Wednesday visits Eugene at the hospital, whose description of the figure he saw at the monster's cave matches Ms. Thornhill, a teacher at Nevermore. Weems, disguised as Tyler, and Wednesday get Thornhill to confess that she is Laurel Gates and manipulated Tyler into killing the victims as part of her scheme to resurrect Joseph Crackstone and wipe out all outcasts. However, Gates kills Weems and subdues Wednesday. Using Wednesday's blood, Gates resurrects Crackstone and leaves Wednesday to die, but Goody appears and heals her. Enid, having transformed into her werewolf form, defeats Tyler in his Hyde form while Crackstone breaches Nevermore. With help from Bianca, Wednesday destroys Crackstone, and Eugene helps defeat Gates. Xavier is released from prison, Tyler is detained, and Wednesday departs Nevermore, which is closing for the remainder of the semester.

                        <h2>Maniac</h2>
                    </div>
                    <div class="contain_info">
                        <p>In an alternate reality New York City, where advertising is omnipresent, Owen Milgrim is a man suffering from schizophrenia, but hiding his symptoms from his family, including seeing an imaginary brother named Grimsson (who resembles his brother Jed with a moustache) who keeps reminding him that he is on a mission of some kind. His family runs a successful industrial business and are protecting Jed from accusations of sexual misconduct, something Owen plans on defending him from by providing a false alibi. Eventually, Owen is laid off from his job and refuses his father's offer of working with his company and accepting his money. He hears about Neberdine, a pharmaceutical company, and signs on to test their new drug which can supposedly cure all disorders. While there, he meets the anti-social Annie Landsberg, who Grimsson explains is the agent he needs to see. When he speaks to her, Annie keeps him from getting them both in trouble by "confirming" her association to him, but tells him not to "blow [their] cover". Owen complies as he prepares for the tests.
                        In a flashback, Annie smokes in her apartment by herself, crushing up one of NPB's "A" pills while cursing "This is it, this is the last one." Upon waking from her sober dream, Annie gathers her possession, a photo of a young woman, and reveals she will be going to Salt Lake City in a conversation with an AdBuddy, a person who reads off advertisements to a person in exchange for goods. With her last $20, Annie visits her father who now resides in an A-Void pod, and informs him that she will be going to Salt Lake City, leaving with all his cash and a revolver. Suffering from drug withdrawal and unable to get more from her contact, Annie visits a "DOX STOP", which is an agency that advertises to scrub personal records for a fee and blackmails these "scrubbed" personal records for a fee. Annie decides to pay for Patricia Lugo's (an NPB employee) personal information and intercept her latest appointment as her friend proxy. Even though Annie fails to maintain her act, Patricia decides to help her. When Patricia is unable to help her get in, however, Annie threatens her until Patricia takes another subject's badge and gives it to Annie. At the drug trial, after taking the "A" pill, Annie relives the traumatic death of her sister Ellie in a car accident. 
                        Annie, Owen, and test subject 5 are removed from the group for questioning after the "A" pill test. Annie's results showed prior experience with the pills, and Owen's indicated he did not take the pill at all. Outside project director Dr. Muramoto's office, Owen confides to Annie that he refrained in case she needed to activate him. Muramoto has Owen recount his core trauma during the session. Insisting he ingested a pill, Owen describes a family gathering that led to his attempted suicide. Muramoto disbelieves Owen and forces him to take an "A" pill. Later while questioning Annie, Muramoto falls forward and dies abruptly. Fearing dismissal, Annie and Owen remove negative indicators from their files and leave Muramoto at his desk. Owen tells Annie his actual trauma experience: a "BLIP" (psychotic break) and meeting Grimsson for the first time. After Muramoto is found dead, Dr. Fujita reenlists Dr. James Mantleray to lead the project. Mantleray created the drug but was removed due to personal issues. Mantleray informs GRTA, the super computer controlling the experiment, that Muramoto has died, and GRTA's reaction causes a hardware malfunction that links Annie and Owen during the next phase of "B" pill testing.
                        Annie and Owen have a shared fantasy that they are a married couple, Lin and Bruce. Lin works at a hospice and enlists Bruce's aid in tracking down Wendy, a ring-tailed lemur belonging to one of her patients, Nan. Wendy was stolen by furriers to make into a hat. Lin and Bruce are caught by the furrier and his sons who plan to make them watch them skin Wendy. The Fish and Wildlife Service arrive and get into a shootout with the furrier and his sons while Bruce and Lin escape with Wendy. Lin delivers Wendy to Nan's estranged daughter, Paula Nazlund, as instructed. Lin realizes that she gave Paula the lemur out of hate rather than love as Nan loved Wendy more than Paula. Paula informs Lin she is pregnant with a son she will call "Greg 'Fuck U Nan' Nazlund", the name of the man driving the truck that hit Annie and her sister, killing Ellie and causing Annie to blame herself. Returning home, Lin recounts a memory of her and her sister that is actually from Annie's life. At home Bruce is arrested by Fish and Wildlife, claiming he is solely responsible for stealing Wendy. He sees Grimsson watching from the street.
                        Under the influence of the "B" pill, Annie and Owen then transition into a shared fantasy where they are Arlie and Ollie, two con artist magicians in the 1940s invited to a séance at an exclusive house party. They have an ulterior motive: to find the long lost 53rd chapter of Cervantes' Don Quixote, believed to possess the power to hold people in their fantasies for an eternity. The séance, led by a humanized GRTA computer, provides a distraction for the two to search the house. All the while, Arlie's character has been randomly "zapping" out of the fantasy and into the NPB lab, where she sees visions of the real Annie's past. Back at the NPB lab, Azumi begins to notice the inconsistencies between subjects 1 and 9, realizing their unusual connection under the influence of the drugs. Annie is subsequently taken into questioning by James about her experiences with the "B" pill to see if she should continue her participation in the trial, while Owen and the rest of the subjects wake up from their tests.
                        Annie realizes that her experiences with Owen on the "B" pill are unique, causing her to feel close to him. Owen, however, worries that being connected to Annie in his dreams is a symptom of his schizophrenia, causing him to doubt the study. Azumi fears that Annie and Owen's connection is being caused by the GRTA computer and reveals to James that GRTA is depressed because, after Azumi coded her with basic empathy, GRTA began a workplace romance with Dr. Muramoto and is now in grief over his death. At the behest of Azumi and GRTA, James reluctantly calls in his mother, pop psychologist Dr. Greta Mantleray, with whom he has a contentious and difficult relationship, so that she can treat GRTA, whose intelligence and virtual appearance are modeled after Greta. The subjects are given the "C" pill and begin the final phase of the trial.
                        Annie dreams she is in a fantasy epic with her sister where she is a drunken elf ranger called Annia and her sister is an elf princess named Ellia. Annia is being paid by a dying Ellia to take her to the Lake of the Clouds where the waters are rumored to cure her. Along the way they are taken to a mysterious queen who allows Annia to look in a mirror, where she sees an image of her and Ellie when they are children. Annie remembers who she is in the real world and tearfully hugs Ellia. Meanwhile, Owen dreams that he and his family are mobsters and that he is being forced to wear a wire by the police. He meets Olivia, a fellow student who also works as a waitress and a virtual version of the girl he suffered the BLIP towards, and agrees to study with her later.
                        Annie is still trapped in the fantasy sequence, though now she realizes the world is a dream. She and Ellia continue their quest to find the Lake of Clouds. Ellia begins to remember things from Annie and Ellie's past as well. Owen the mobster accidentally discovers that his brother, Jed, has been working undercover for the police, but Jed is killed, leading Owen to go into witness protection. He asks Olivia to come with him, but seven children later he leaves her by jumping out a window. Remembering who he is and remembering Annie, he transforms into a hawk and travels into Annie's fantasy realm. Annia and Ellia arrive at the Lake of Clouds, which is actually the place where Ellie was killed. GRTA as Queen Gertrude arrives and offers to let Annie stay forever. Annie accepts believing that she will be able to stay with Ellie but is instead spirited away from her. Greta meanwhile learns from GRTA that she has lost faith in the value of human life after her love died and plans on keeping the subjects prisoners in their own minds, before Greta violently wakes up.
                        Greta tries to warn James and Azumi of the threat GRTA poses, but they do not believe her and the stress makes James go blind, which they believe to be psychosomatic. Soon after, GRTA takes control by taking over the system, locking the staff in the control room and electrocuting orderly Carl when he tries to pull the override switch. Meanwhile, Owen and Annie are in a new shared dream, where Owen is Snorri, an Icelandic UN agent accused of murdering a seemingly friendly Extraterrestrial whose family wants revenge. Before he is executed, he is saved by Annie, a CIA sleeper agent who reveals the alien was always hostile. As they go to stop the threat, they encounter Grimsson, who helps them remember who they are. Owen goes with Grimsson while Annie goes on her own to find Ellie. On the way, she meets GRTA's projection, who she convinces to live with her pain instead of lashing out. In doing so, she is able to say goodbye to Ellie, who leaves with GRTA. Owen completes his mission by solving a Rubik's Cube, which frees the controllers in the real world. This makes Grimsson disappear, seemingly for good, and allows Azumi and James, whose eyesight comes back, to shut GRTA down permanently.
                        After the subjects wake up, the experiment ends and they are allowed to go home with their payment. As they say goodbye, Owen assures a confused Annie that he will not pursue a relationship with her. For the mistakes they have made, James and Azumi are fired from Neberdine and told off by both Greta and Neberdine's CEO. While leaving, they rekindle their former relationship. Annie decides to go to Salt Lake City and makes amends with her father, who has decided to leave the A-Void pod. Realizing how fond she has become of him, she decides to invite Owen along. However, she learns from a newspaper that he told the truth at Jed's trial and has been subsequently committed. Owen can only see two options for their relationship (Options A and B). She manages to sneak into the asylum and finds him within, and convinces him that they have a future together. He is convinced the treatment did not work and is certain one of two things will happen: either Annie will turn out to not be real, or he will have another BLIP and cause her to leave. She convinces him to take that chance and they sneak out and head to Salt Lake together. </p>
